### Detailed Output
The k6 performance test ran for 2 minutes using `simple-load-test.js` with VUs ramping up to simulated load. Thanks to the newly configured Vercel Protection Bypass header (`x-vercel-protection-bypass: qgBhp0e5McWwZIscbbeMdhrMS3Ryzv4B`), requests were able to bypass Vercel's SSO gateway and directly access the application home page. 

- **All requests** returned `200 OK`.
- **Response times** were stable, with an average of `501.28ms` and a median of `410.39ms`.
- **Threshold checks** for HTTP request success rate and response times passed.
