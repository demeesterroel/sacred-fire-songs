# Documentation Sync Policy

All project artifacts must remain 100% synchronized with the codebase and each other.

- **Requirement**: Every code change must be reflected in `application-analysis&design.md`.
- **Traceability**: Before completing a task, verify the implementation against the acceptance criteria in `epic&user stories.md`.
- **UI Consistency**: If a UI screen is modified, it must be compared against the visual description in the `screen*.html` mockups.
- **Artifact Alignment**: Propose specific edits to inconsistent files as soon as discrepancies are found during the audit phase.
- **Version Management**: Update the version status in `application-analysis&design.md` and related documents (following `doc-changelog-policy.md`) if significant changes are made.
- **Definition of Done**: A task is not "Done" until documentation, tests, and code are in 100% alignment.
