# Verification Rule

- **Preview Deployment Verification**: Always ask the user to verify the finished development on the preview website before merging any branch to `main`. Do not merge automatically without explicit user confirmation of verification.

# Artifact Synchronization Rule

- **Feature Branch Logbook Sync**: Always commit logbook artifact updates (`master-walkthrough.md`, `master-tasks.md`, `master-timetracking.md`) directly on the feature branch **before** opening a Pull Request or merging to `main`. Never push artifact updates directly to `main`.

# Database Environment Rule

- **Database Separation**:
  - **Development (DEV)**: Use the locally installed Supabase stack for local development.
  - **Testing (TEST/E2E)**: Use the isolated testing database (as configured in `.env.test`).
  - **Preview**: Auto-deployed per branch/PR — uses the **staging** Supabase project.
  - **Beta**: Self-hosted Docker build, pinned to a commit SHA — uses **staging** Supabase.
  - **Production**: Uses the **production** Supabase project. Never point preview/test environments at prod.

- **Staging Database Activity Check**: If Preview, Beta, or any DEV environment using Supabase staging returns zero songs, **always check first if the staging Supabase project is running** (as it may have been automatically paused due to inactivity).

# Repository Isolation Rule

`sacred-fire-songs` is a **public open-source project**. It must NEVER contain references to private deployment infrastructure. Specifically:

- **No private hostnames**: Do not mention `app.songbook.rocks`, `songbook.bluette.be`, `songbook-beta.bluette.be`, or any VPS/Hetzner domain.
- **No parent project references**: Do not mention `songbook-rocks` in issues, comments, docs, or code.
- **No Vercel project names or URLs**: Keep all Vercel-specific deployment config out of this repo.
- **No deployment performance scripts**: Benchmark scripts targeting live production/staging endpoints belong in `songbook-rocks/testing/performance/`, not here.
- **Allowed**: Unit tests, Playwright E2E tests, local Supabase dev setup, and generic open-source documentation.
