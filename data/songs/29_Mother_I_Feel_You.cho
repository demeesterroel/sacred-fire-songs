Mother I feel you under my feet. 
Mother I can feel your heart beat (2x) 
Hey ya (7x) ho [G] 

Sister I can hear you in the river's song. 
Eternal waters flowing on and on (2x) 
Hey ya (7x) ho 

Father I can see you in the eagles flight. 
Light of the Spirit's gonna take us higher (2x) 
Hey ya (7x) ho 

Brother I can see you in the fire flame 
Dancing and drumming's gonna make us stronger (2x) 
Hey ya (7x) ho
