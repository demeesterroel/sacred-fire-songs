{title: 16. Down to the river}
[G]As I went down to the river to pray 
[D]Studying about that good old [G]way 
And who shall *wear the starry crown 
[D]Good Lord [C]show me the [G]way 

Oh [D]*Sisters, let's go [G]down 
[C]Let's go down, come on [G]down 
Oh sisters, let's go [D]down 
[C]Down in the river to [G]pray
