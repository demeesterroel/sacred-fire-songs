## Phase 1: The Bare Essentials (MVP)

**Focus:** Core song management and basic public viewing.

### Epic 1.1: Song Management (Admin)

**Story 1.1.1: [Implemented]** As a Member, I want to add a song using a web form so that I can share medicine with the community.

```
Scenario: Admin uploads via Form
  Given I am logged in as an Admin
  And I am on the "Add Song" page
  When I fill in the Title "New Song" and Content "[C]Lyrics"
  And I click the "Add Song" button
  Then a new song should be created in the database
  And I should be redirected to the Home page
```

**Story 1.1.2: [Implemented]** As an Admin, I want to upload a raw `.cho` file via an expandable upload section to auto-fill the form so that I don't have to type metadata manually.

```
Scenario: Import metadata from File via Expandable Section
  Given I am on the Add Song page
  When I click the "Or upload a file" toggle
  And I select a file containing "{title: Grandmother Earth} {author: Traditional}"
  Then the "Title" field should be automatically filled with "Grandmother Earth"
  And the "Author" field should be automatically filled with "Traditional"
  And the "Content" field should be filled with the file body
```

**Story 1.1.2-bis: [Implemented]** As an Admin, I want pasted metadata (title/author) in the lyrics field to populate the form fields automatically so that I can copy-paste full song files easily.

```
Scenario: Smart Paste
  Given I am on the Add Song page
  When I paste content containing "{title: Grandmother Earth} {author: Traditional}" into the "Lyrics & chords" textarea
  Then the "Title" field should be filled with "Grandmother Earth"

  And the "Lyrics & chords" field should contain only the song content
```

**Story 1.1.3: [Implemented]** As an Admin, I want to delete a song so that I can remove duplicate or incorrect entries.

```

```

**Story 1.1.6:** As a Content Contributor, I want the system to automatically detect and convert songs formatted with "Chords over Lyrics" into standard ChordPro format, so that I don't have to manually reformat existing song sheets when adding them to the library.

  Given I am on the "Add Song" page
  When I paste text with chords over lyrics into the "Lyrics & chords" textarea
