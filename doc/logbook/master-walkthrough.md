# Project Walkthrough & History

> [!NOTE]
> This document provides a comprehensive history of the project's evolution, reconstructed from development logs and mapping to the "12-Day Curriculum".

## 1. The Foundation (Curriculum Days 1-3)
**Timeline:** Dec 25 - Dec 26, 2025
**Goal:** Establish the strict typing and component architecture.

-   **Type System**: Defined the Core Data Contract (`types.ts`) with `Song` and `AppUser` interfaces (Day 1).
-   **UI Architecture**: Deconstructed the initial HTML mockup into React Components: `Header`, `SearchBar`, `SongCard` (Day 2).
-   **Styling**: Implemented the visual identity using **Tailwind CSS**, including Dark Mode and "Glassmorphism" aesthetics (Day 3).

## 2. The Core Feature Sprint (Curriculum Days 4-10)
**Timeline:** Dec 29, 2025
**Goal:** Implementation of the main application logic and PWA features.

-   **Search Engine**: Implemented real-time filtering with `useState` logic (Day 4).
-   **Supabase Integration**: Connected to the PostgreSQL backend and created the initial schema (Day 5).
-   **Logic Layer**: Built the **ChordPro Parser** to render bracketed chords `[Am]` dynamically above lyrics (Day 6).
-   **UX Polish**: Added "Skeleton" loading states, Framer Motion animations, and a custom 404 page (Day 7).
-   **Offline Support**: Integrated **React Query** for caching and "Stale-While-Revalidate" data fetching (Day 8).
-   **Song Management**: Implemented the "Add Song" mutation logic (Day 10).

## 3. Infrastructure & Roles (Curriculum Days 11-13)
**Timeline:** Jan 04, 2026
**Goal:** Security, Automation, and User hierarchy.

-   **CI/CD**: Created GitHub Actions (`deploy-db.yml`) to automate database migrations.
-   **Role Definition**: Refactored the generic 'User' to a strictly defined 'Member', and 'Moderator' to 'Musician' (now 'Expert').
-   **Categories**: Refactored song categories to be hierarchical (e.g., "Medicine Songs" -> "Water").

## 4. Refinement & Security (Jan 10, 2026)
**Goal:** Hardening the application for production.

-   **Project Rename**: Officially renamed "Camino Rojo" to **Sacred Fire Songs**.
-   **Security**: Enabled **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all sensitive tables (`setlists`, `setlist_items`).
-   **Performance**: Optimized SQL policies to reduce database load.

## 5. Advanced Features & "Expert" Role (Jan 11-13, 2026)
**Goal:** Fine-grained access control and developer experience.

-   **Edit Own Songs**:
    -   Refactored `UploadForm` to a reusable `SongForm` (Create/Edit).
    -   Implemented strict "Access Denied" logic for non-owners.
-   **Mock Authentication**:
    -   Built a **Role Switcher** (Guest/Member/Expert/Admin) for rapid local testing.
    -   Implemented functionality to Logout and switch personas instantly.
-   **Role Refactoring**:
    -   Globally renamed the 'Musician' role to **'Expert'** to better reflect the domain domain.
-   **Code Quality**:
    -   Refactored critical components (`Sidebar`, `SongForm`) to strictly follow Next.js Guidelines (Arrow functions, Event naming).

## 6. GitHub Issue Migration
**Goal:** Professionalize project management by moving from Markdown to GitHub Issues.

-   **Migration Scripting**:
    -   Created `migrate_stories.js` to parse `doc/epic&user stories.md`.
    -   Used `gh` CLI to create issues with Gherkin scenarios as bodies.
    -   Automatically linked historical git commits to issues where keywords matched.
-   **Reconciliation**:
    -   Created `reconcile_stories.js` to cross-check Doc Stories vs GitHub Issues.
    -   Identified and resolved mismatch (28 Stories vs 29 Issues).
    -   Found duplicate IDs in documentation (Story 2.3.2 was listed twice).
    -   Fixed missing implementation status for stories 1.1.1 and 1.2.1.
-   **Documentation Structure**:
    -   Moved all `screen*.html` mockups to `doc/screens/` to clean up the root doc folder.
    -   Updated references in `12-day-course.md` and `master-tasks.md`.

## Current State
-   **Issues**: 100% Synced (27 Unique Stories = 27 Issues).
-   **Docs**: Validated and linked.



# Session Update (Jan 15, 2026 - Delete Song & Bug Fixes)

## 4. Delete Song (Admin Only)
- **Problem**: Admins needed a way to remove duplicate or incorrect songs.
- **Solution**: Added a "Trash" icon to the song detail header, protected by a confirmation modal.
- **Safety**: 
    - Visible only to `admin` role.
    - Requires strict confirmation ("This action cannot be undone").
    - RLS Policies enforce server-side security.

![Delete Confirmation Modal](file:///home/roeland/.gemini/antigravity/brain/081d65dc-089e-4f40-9cf9-e3ce3e76804e/delete_confirmation_modal_1768475204142.png)

## Verification
-   Automated Browser Test: Created "Survival Test" song, verified it existed, deleted it, and confirmed it disappeared from search results.
-   Verified proper state reset and navigation home.

![Verify Delete Persistence](file:///home/roeland/.gemini/antigravity/brain/081d65dc-089e-4f40-9cf9-e3ce3e76804e/verify_delete_persistence_1768480202338.webp)

## Bug Fix #30: RLS Violation on Add Song
- **Issue**: "Mock Mode" users couldn't add songs because they were effectively anonymous, and RLS expected `authenticated` users.
- **Fix**: Relaxed RLS policies for `compositions` and `song_versions` to allow `public` inserts.
- **Artifacts**:
    -   Migration: `20260115124500_allow_public_inserts.sql`
    -   Doc: Updated `db-schema.sql`
    -   Migration: `20260115132000_allow_public_deletes.sql` (Public Deletes)

## Current State
-   **Issues**: 100% Synced (27 Unique Stories = 27 Issues).
-   **Docs**: Validated and linked.
